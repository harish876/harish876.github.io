        <p>Hi I am Harish Krishnakumar. I use neovim btw. I love databases, interpreters, distributed systems, and dev tools. I am currently building <a href="https://memlens.vercel.app/">Memlens</a>, building AI agents <a href="https://github.com/harish876/CodeRefineAI">CodeRefineAI</a> and benchmarking C and Rust <a href="https://github.com/harish876/WebServerPerf">here</a>.</p>
<p>My coding journey began in grade 11 when C++ became part of my academic curriculum, and I had no idea how to even write a <code>while</code> loop. Over time, I gradually improved—from barely scraping through exams to finally developing a solid grasp of coding fundamentals. However, for most of my college years, I struggled with a lack of inspiration and motivation for computer science—until my senior year, when everything changed. I had to prepare for my placements and I started competitive programming and learning some full stack development. I worked hard enough to use these skills to land a wonderful internship at byju&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This is where I fell in love with what I was doing. I started programming almost every night after work and started reading about different things, started watching programming streams on youtube to observe how the people who have it figured out build out an idea. It was exhilarating. I did a bunch of full stack projects, writing 10+ table joins, struggling with ORM&rsquo;s like my life depended. Life was awesome, I was losing sleep thinking about work and I was so happy to finally work on something I liked.</p>
<p>But as all good things come to an end, after layoffs in my team and months of uncertainty I decided to move to SMC Finance, as a full time.</p>
<p>After working on ETL pipelines, full stack projects and other fun things at SMC, I was ready to take my passion and relive my college life by doing a Master&rsquo;s. I wanted to be on top of things in the tech world and as with most things in life, the rate at which life moves is always greater than the rate your passion and competencies grow. Dont quote me on that, but I lost a sense of joy momentarily.</p>
<p>I wanted to fall in love again with the thing I do, and as silly as it sounds, I want to just enjoy it now. Not get on top of things, not be better, but be better for myself and enjoy and feel like I did when I first started out. Hence here is my little personal site, where I will write blogs on the projects I have done and stuff I find interesting and it kindles maybe some intrest in you again.</p>
<p>This is my way of showing the world, a little more than what my <a href="/resume/">resume</a> shows and hopefully conveys something meaningful.</p>
<p>Hope you like my <a href="/posts/">blog</a>!</p>
