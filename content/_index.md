# Hi, there

Hi I am Harish Krishnakumar. I use neovim btw. I have 2 years of experience working in Software at Byju's and SMC Finance as a Software Engineering intern and a full time respectively. I am currently pursuing my Master's in CS at UC Davis.

As an intern at Byju's I worked on microservices, dealing with the payment system and migrating a batch based archiecture to a queue based one using Apache Kafka.I made a fun little configuration builder to dynamically create rule engines for different payment vendors.

As a full time at SMC Finance, I built a "refer and earn" from scratch , from the design documentation all the way to writing some terraform for deployment. I created a ETL pipeline framework for cross functional use using python. I also wrote a sweet little stock data aggregator in Go using priority queues.

I am really passionate about databases and systems programming. I am currently working formally at [ExpoLabs](https://expolab.org/) as a Student Assistant under Professor [Mohammad Sadoghi](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/sadoghi/) contributing to the Apache ResilientDB ecosystem. I am also working at the DavSec under Professor [Tapti Palit](https://taptipalit.github.io/) in limited capacity benchmarking web servers written in C and Rust.

Check out my [blog](/posts). I am reachable [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harish-gokul01/) or you can learn more about me [here](/whoami).
