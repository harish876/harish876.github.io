## [1.DeepObserve](https://github.com/harish876/DeepObserve)
Deep observability, Visualization and monitoring tool for distributed systems using eBPF. Big WIP...

## [2.SDR_RDMA_UDP](https://github.com/harish876/SDR_RDMA_UDP)
Research prototype implementing Software-Defined Reliability for RDMA and UDP with erasure coding mechanisms for cross-WAN communication. Enables reliable data transmission for distributed AI training workloads using Forward Error Correction (FEC) and chunked transmission aligned to MTU boundaries.

## [3.docstore](https://github.com/harish876/docstore)
Document store implementation for efficient document storage and retrieval.

## [4.PipeQL](https://github.com/harish876/PipeQL)
A query language that treats SQL statements as UNIX commands using pipe operators. PipeQL queries compile to MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) for execution, built on top of LingoDB. Implements a grammar-based parser using ANTLR and integrates with the LingoDB framework to generate optimized query execution code.

## [5.MemLens](https://github.com/harish876/MemLens)
Building granular observability and monitoring tool for [Apache ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.incubator.apache.org/).

## [6.Disel](https://github.com/harish876/disel)
Simple HTTP framework written in Go from scratch. Implemented simple http protocol over raw tcp.

## [7.Lox Lang](https://github.com/harish876/lox-lang)
Implementation of the Lox programming language interpreter as part of the "Build Your Own Interpreter" challenge from codecrafters.
This Challenge follows the first 3 chapters of [Crafting Interpreter by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

## [8.Forge LSP](https://github.com/harish876/forge-lsp)
LSP Server for the Forge ETL Framework and a VS Code client. Built using tree-sitter and JSON RPC. Handrolled the entire LSP protocol.Provides config autocompletion and jump-to-definition features.
