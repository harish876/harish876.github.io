Hi there, I am Harish Krishnakumar. I used to use neovim, but I've switched to Cursor. I'm a glorified vibe coder, but I think I do some cool stuff. I am currently pursuing my Master's in CS at UC Davis, and I'm passionate about **systems**, **databases**, and **observability**.

I'm currently in the job market and would love to explore entry to mid-level opportunities. I exhibit high ownership, agency, and interest in the work I do.

From an **observability** standpoint, I'm building [DeepObserve](https://github.com/harish876/DeepObserve) - a deep observability and visualization tool for distributed systems using eBPF. This project focuses on providing granular insights into system behavior and performance.

From a **databases** perspective, I'm working on [docstore](https://github.com/harish876/docstore) - a document store implementation for efficient document storage and retrieval. I'm also contributing to the Apache ResilientDB ecosystem at ExpoLabs under Professor Mohammad Sadoghi.

From a **systems** standpoint, I'm exploring high-performance networking with [SDR_RDMA_UDP](https://github.com/harish876/SDR_RDMA_UDP) - implementing Software-Defined Reliability for RDMA and UDP with erasure coding for cross-WAN communication. I'm also benchmarking web servers written in C and Rust at DavSec under Professor Tapti Palit, comparing their performance characteristics and trade-offs.
